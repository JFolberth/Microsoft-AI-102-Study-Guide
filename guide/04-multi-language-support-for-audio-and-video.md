# 4. [Multi-Language Support for Audio and Video](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support)

Key concept:
- Input language: many services auto-detect or accept candidate languages.  
- Output language: must be configured for translation/synthesis.

- Language detection (Text Analytics): https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/language-service/language-detection/how-to/call-api  
- Translator REST: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/translator/reference/v3-0-translate  
- Speech translation: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-translation

Practical tip: for audio/video, provide candidate languages to improve detection; explicitly set target locales/voice names for outputs (e.g., `es-ES`, `en-US-JennyNeural`).
